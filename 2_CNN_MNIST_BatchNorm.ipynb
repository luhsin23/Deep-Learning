    "1. L1 regularization (Lasso) adds a penalty equal to the **absolute value of the coefficients** to the model's loss function. This forces some model coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating less important features. $\\\\$\n",
    "   L2 regularization (Ridge) adds a penalty equal to the **square of the coefficients** to the loss function. This discourages large coefficients but does not usually set them to zero—rather, it shrinks them toward zero. L2 regularization helps prevent overfitting while ensuring that all features are retained.  $\\\\$\n",
    "   Specifically, in math, $\\\\$\n",
    "   L1 loss function:\n",
    "$$J(\\mathrm{w})=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y_i-\\hat{y}_i\\right)^2+\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p\\left|w_j\\right|$$\n",
    "L2 loss function:\n",
    "$$J(\\mathbf{w})=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y_i-\\hat{y}_i\\right)^2+\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p w_j^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "- $J(\\mathbf{w})$ is the total loss\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y_i-\\hat{y}_i\\right)^2$ is the standard least squares error\n",
    "- $\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p\\left|w_j\\right|$ is the L1 penalty term\n",
    "- $\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p w_j^2$ is the L2 penalty term\n",
    "\n",
    "The derative of the L1 penalty is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{d w_j} \\lambda\\left|w_j\\right|= \\begin{cases}\\lambda, & w_j>0 \\\\ -\\lambda, & w_j<0 \\\\ \\left(\\text { undefined at } w_j=0\\right) & \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that instead of shrinking all coefficients proportionally, L1 applies a constant push each time. I also believe that when a weight crosses zero, many optimization algorithms set it exactly to zero. That's how some weights can be pushed to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of the L2 penalty term is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{d w_j} \\lambda w_j^2=2 \\lambda w_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This means larger coefficients get shrunk more, while smaller coefficients get shrunk less.\n",
    "Since the derivative is smooth and differentiable everywhere, L2 almost never forces coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. L1 regularization promotes sparsity by forcing some coefficients to be zero. It is useful for feature selection, especially when dealing with a large number of features and wanting to keep only the most important ones. Therefore, I would use L1 for large features if I want a sparser model. In cases where there are more features than observations, L1 helps avoid overfitting by selecting only the most relevant features. $\\\\$\n",
    "L2 regularization penalizes large coefficients more heavily but does not set them to zero. Instead, it shrinks them proportionally, meaning that smaller coefficients are penalized less. L2 regularization is preferred when you believe that all features matter (such as payment history and debt-to-income ratio in credit scoring). Additionally, if you have only a small number of features and do not want one or two to dominate the results, L2 can help prevent overfitting by discouraging large weights and ensuring that no single feature has excessive influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting in neural networks by randomly setting weights to zero for a fraction of the neurons during training. \n",
    "- When neurons are dropped out during training, it forces the network not to rely on any particular neuron for making predictions. It **reduces over-reliance on specific neurons** by randomly removing them, which prevents the model from becoming too dependent on any single neuron and reduces the risk of overfitting to noise or irrelevant patterns.\n",
    "- In the paper, the authors suggest that dropout helps reduce overfitting by breaking up complex **co-adaptations** between neurons. Co-adaptations refer to the case where neurons become overly reliant on one another. So, if one of these neurons is missing or behaves differently (due to new data or noise), the other may fail to function properly because they were too dependent on each other. Dropout works by randomly \"turning off\" (or \"dropping\") some neurons during training. When a neuron is turned off, it can no longer rely on other neurons. This forces the network to learn features in a more independent and generalizable way.\n",
    "- Dropout creates different **thinned network** by randomly dropping units during training. Each of these models learns to make predictions based on a different subset of neurons. By training many 'thinned' networks, dropout forces the network to learn more robust, generalized features. Each 'thinned' network can be seen as a unique model and trained simultaneously. When making predictions, the network combines these models, leading to an ensemble effect that improves generalization and prevents overfitting."

    "**YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The training data is captured in the artist's studio, where all photos of the artworks were taken under controlled conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perfect angle and lighting: The photos are likely to be taken from a single angle with ideal lighting, which will be consistent across all images in the dataset.\n",
    "- No background: The artworks are isolated against a neutral background, which makes it easier for the model to identify the artwork itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world conditions could vary significantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different angles: Users will take photos from different angles, which can distort the perspective of the artwork.\n",
    "- Different lighting: The lighting in public spaces will vary (e.g., natural sunlight, streetlights, or dark environments), which could affect the visibility of the artwork.\n",
    "- Different backgrounds: Real-world images may contain backgrounds (e.g., people, vehicles, or buildings) that can make it more challenging for the model to focus on the artwork.\n",
    "- Different camera quality: Users' phone cameras may have different resolutions, focus quality, and image noise, which could affect the model’s ability to clearly detect the artwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To address the real-world conditions and make the model more robust, we can use the following **data augmentation** techniques:\n",
    "- Rotation and flipping: We can randomly rotate images within a certain angle range (e.g., -30° to 30°). This will simulate users taking photos from different angles. Or we can flip the image horizontally or vertically to simulate different orientations.\n",
    "- Brightness and contrast adjustments: We can randomly vary the brightness of the image by increasing or decreasing pixel values or vary the contrast by adjusting the difference between light and dark areas.\n",
    "- Random cropping: We can crop out a random section of the image to simulate varying parts of the artwork being visible.\n",
    "- Adding noise: We can add random noise (Gaussian noise) to each pixel, which simulates poor image quality or environmental factors like rain or low light.\n",
    "- Variations in Color: We can adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness of an image randomly to simulate different lighting conditions or different photo qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I think random rotation by 90°, 180°, or 270° or flipping vertically will not work. The artworks may have a specific orientation when installed in public spaces; however, taking photos from random orientations will not be as extreme as rotating by 90° or 180°. Therefore, applying such extreme rotations during training could lead the model to learn incorrect representations, especially for mosaic-style artwork. This is because it would render the artwork upside down, making the tiles look entirely different in the context of the image and distorting the intended design. The same applies to flipping, especially vertical flipping. Just like with Pac-Man, flipping it vertically would change its design and make it unrecognizable. In the same way, vertical flipping of a mosaic artwork would distort the arrangement of its tiles, changing the overall appearance of the artwork."

    "**YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Faster Convergence with BatchNorm:**\n",
    "- The BatchNorm model (orange) reaches 90% accuracy in under 1,000 steps, while the non-BatchNorm model takes significantly longer (~3,000+ steps).\n",
    "- This confirms that BatchNorm speeds up learning by stabilizing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Higher Final Accuracy with BatchNorm:**\n",
    "- The BatchNorm model reaches ~99% test accuracy, while the non-BatchNorm model stays slightly lower (~97-98%).\n",
    "- This indicates that BatchNorm improves generalization in addition to training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without BatchNorm: Slower but Still Converges Well**\n",
    "- The non-BatchNorm model still reaches high accuracy, but takes longer to stabilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Did I duplicate the results?\n",
    "\n",
    "- No, but with a small tweak, yes.\n",
    "- I used the same specification as in the paper. \n",
    "    * First Hidden Layer: A linear (fully connected) layer with 100 neurons. \n",
    "    * Second Hidden Layer: Another linear layer with 100 neurons.\n",
    "    * Third Hidden Layer: A third linear layer with 100 neurons.\n",
    "    * A final linear layer with 10 output neurons, corresponding to the 10 digit classes (0-9). No activation function is applied at this stage because the CrossEntropyLoss function.\n",
    "- However, I used ReLU instead of Sigmoid as the activation function after each hidden layer.\n",
    "- I tried using Sigmoid as suggested by the paper, and the results are attached at the end of the code. However, the examples without BatchNorm could not be trained at all. The examples using BatchNorm perform similarly to those in the paper, although they are still slightly worse.\n",
